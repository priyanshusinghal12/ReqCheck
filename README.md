# ReqCheck

Hosted on https://req-check.vercel.app/

This is ReqCheck, the one-click tool to check your progress on your major's requirements and simulate how your future courses will affect your progress. Explore our code. 

We have two folders:

Backend - with the course_logic directory which contains helper functions in a file, tests in a file, and the check major requirements function for each major that we have in the app. We use a transript parsing script using pdf plumber, We have main.py and saveResults.py which are the FAST API backend with routes rendered on Render. 

Frontend - we have folders with pages, components and routes. A basic React structure using the Vite Framework. We are using a lot of libraries like Framer Motion, EmailJS, ParticlesJS etc.

Any questions you have you can mail us at psinghal@uwaterloo.ca and/or r8madan@uwaterloo.ca


Hope you like our project!
